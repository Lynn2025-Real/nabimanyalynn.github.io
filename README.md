# Business Applications Support Officer

## About Me
In this technologically fast-paced age, industries leverage digital systems to increase efficiency, productivity and to stand out in an increasingly competitive environment. According to Forbes, 94% of firms worldwide are already making the shift toward digital transformation. Companies that use technology to their advantage streamline operations and grow faster, with fewer headaches.
Yet, as companies embrace and depend on digital business systems, so too does the risk of disruption, cyber threats and costly downtime. That is where professional Business Applications Support becomes not just beneficial but essential. 
Here is where I come in. With a background in Computer Science and 5+ years of experience supporting and maintaining business critical systems, I value what digital systems do for businesses and support end users who get stuck during their day-to-day processing.
